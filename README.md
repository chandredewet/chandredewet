### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I studied programming many many years ago and qualified with a BTech in Information Technology, but my career took a turn after, being more in Tech Support/Administration and Documentation, as well other paths in Education, Admin and Community Work. After taking a break, in 2020 a friend invited me to volunteer for the amazing organization [CodeYourFuture.io](https://codeyourfuture.io/) teaching some of the modules in the web development bootcamp. This ignited the spark and I decided to do the course myself and here I am about to enter the working world as a dev 20 years after graduating. Nothing one learns is wasted and I am excited to see how all that I have learnt comes together with all my past experiences and impacts my future teams, projects and dreams.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finishing my 9 Month Software Development BootCamp. About to embark on a Final Project for External Client.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL and AWS Cloud.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data visualisation projects for South African heritage projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting from a noob developer to being established.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about javascript, html and css, ITIL concepts.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/chandredewet/
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love art, travel, cultures, writing but my first love is the detective work I do in my sparetime uncovering history in South Africa.
